# NETWORK TOPOLOGY

## What is Network Topology?
Network topology refers to the arrangement of devices (nodes), cables, and connections in a network and how data flows between them. It defines the structure of a network, both physically (how devices are connected) and logically (how data moves).
- In simple terms:
  - Physical topology = The actual layout of cables and devices.
  - Logical topology = The path data takes through the network.

## Why is Network Topology Important?
- Performance: Determines speed and efficiency of data transfer.
- Scalability: How easily you can expand the network.
- Fault Tolerance: How well the network handles failures.
- Cost: Influences cabling and hardware requirements.
