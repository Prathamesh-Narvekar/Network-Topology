# Point-to-Point Topology

## What is Point-to-Point Topology?
Point-to-Point Topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver. Point-to-Point provides high bandwidth.

## Key Characteristics
- Direct Communication: Only two nodes are involved, so data travels directly without intermediaries.
- High Performance: Since there’s no congestion from other devices, it offers low latency and high speed.
- Simplicity: Easy to set up and manage.
- Reliability: If the link fails, communication stops completely (single point of failure).

## Examples
- A computer connected to a printer via USB.
- A leased line between two offices.
- A dedicated VPN tunnel between two endpoints.

## Advantages
- Fast and secure communication.
- Minimal configuration required.

## Disadvantages
- Not scalable—adding more devices requires additional links.
- Failure of the link breaks the connection entirely.
