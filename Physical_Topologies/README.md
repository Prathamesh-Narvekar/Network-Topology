# Physical Topology

## What is Physical Topology?
Physical topology refers to the actual physical layout of devices, cables, and network components in a network. It shows how devices are physically connected to each other using wires, switches, hubs, etc.

## Key Points
- It deals with the real-world arrangement of hardware (not the logical flow of data).
- Determines cabling requirements, installation complexity, and fault tolerance.

## Common physical topologies include:
- Bus: All devices share one backbone cable.
- Star: Devices connect to a central hub/switch.
- Ring: Devices form a closed loop.
- Mesh: Devices interconnect with multiple paths.
- Tree: Hierarchical structure combining star and bus.
- Hybrid: Mix of two or more topologies.

## Why It Matters
- Physical topology affects network performance, cost, and maintenance.
- Helps in planning network expansion and troubleshooting.

## Difference from Logical Topology
- Physical topology = How devices are physically connected.
- Logical topology = How data flows within the network (e.g., Ethernet uses logical bus even if physical star).
